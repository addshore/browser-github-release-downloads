**Long Description**

```
This extension displays the number of downloads GitHub releases have on the releases page.
Adds current download counts to the releases page on Github for custom release artifacts using the GitHub API.

GitHub tracks the number of downloads for all assets (files) that are attached to a release, but GitHub currently makes it very hard for users to get at this information.
